Minimalistic python framework for training HEP-based neural networks.  

_Under development_

Developed to read ROOT files (via [uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot)) 
and pass the data to [keras](https://keras.io/) (+[tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)) for machine learning.

The framework uses a single text file to quickly prototype different hyperparameter configurations.
Relevant plots (to our analysis work) are generated with matplotlib (& [hepPlotter](https://github.com/demarley/hepPlotter)) and saved as well.

## Software Versions

- matplotlib
- numpy
- keras
